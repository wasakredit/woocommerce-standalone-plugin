## Translations

The plugin uses `__("Default name", "wasa-kredit-checkout")` to make it possible to translate it.
For now it is translated to Swedish. To translate it to other languages we recommend Loco Translate (a plugin for Wordpress).

## Checkout

The checkout is a pretty standard WooCommerce Payment Gateway. You can find documentation here:
https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/payment-gateway-api/

A special page for the checkout is automatically generated and if the user accesses this page it will
always use the template in ./templates/checkout.php. This is a way for give the administrator the ability
to add information or content on top of the checkout page.
